## Training process
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  DNA_bert_finetuning_average_L2.ipynb can reproduce the our training process;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  DNA_bert_finetuning_average_L2_K_Flod.ipynb show the process of 5-fold cross validation;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  DNA_Bert_finetuning_L2_ensemble.ipynb exhibit the best performance of our four classification model and present the integration result of these models.<br>

## Motif  analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  motif_Attention_output.ipynb shows the process of calculating weight of each nucleotide in its original sequence by the attention mechanism in iEhancer-ELM. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  motif_analysis,ipynb shows the process of using attention weight of nucleotide to retrieve the potential patterns, and then filter by hypergeometric testã€‚ Finally, merge the patterns into the final motifs based on sequence similarity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Folder of atten saves the result of motif analysis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The folder of analysis shows the t-SNE analysis redult ofsequence embedding.
