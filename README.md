iEnhancer-ELM: Learning Explainable Contextual Information to Improve Enhancer Identification using Enhancer Language Models

## Benchmark Dataset
The benchmark dataset used in our article is from Liuet al.[1], which consists of a training dataset and an independent dataset. In the training dataset, there are 1484 enhancer sequences and 1484 non-enhancer sequences. And there are 742 enhancer sequences and 742 non-enhancer sequences in the independent dataset. The files with a k-mer in its  file name represents the result of our overlapping tokenization result of the training dataset or the independent dataset.

## Code
We add the analysis codes to this folder. In the motif analysis, we refer to some codes from Ji et al.[2]. We add the result of motif analysis in the folder of 'atten'. The folder of 'analysis' contains the t-SNE analysis process of sequence embedding
